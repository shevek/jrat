The Silent provider doesn't do anything with events. It is used
when no handler is configured for a method. This happens in two cases.
<ol>
    <li>If JRat is not configured at all. This handler will be used for all
        events
    </li>
    <li>If JRat is configured, it is using the ChainMethodHandlerFactory,
        which makes the final determination what handlers to be used. It can
        assign zero, one, or many handlers to a single method. In the case where
        the chain handler determins that zero handlers are configured for a method,
        a silent handler will be used.
    </li>
</ol>
