        <h>The Configuration File</h>

        JRat loads its configuration from a file named
        <b>jrat.xml</b>
        in the current directory
        of your application.

        This file contains system-wide configuration parameters, and also JRat handlers to be
        configured and assigned to sets of classes and methods.

        <h>The Default File</h>

        If JRat starts up and can't find it's configuration file, it will create one.

        The default file provides sensible defaults and provides a good sample for new users.

            <h>A Simple Example</h>
            The following is is a very simple configuration file.

            <code><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jrat>
    <settings>
        <property name="httpServerEnabled" value="true"/>
    </settings>

    <profile name="my code">

        <criteria>
            <include/>
        </criteria>

        <handlers>

            <handler factory="org.shiftone.jrat.provider.tree.TreeMethodHandlerFactory">
                <property name="outputFile" value="my_code_tree.jrat"/>
            </handler>

        </handlers>

    </profile>
</jrat> ]]></code>

        <section>
            <h>Settings (Global)</h>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h>Profiles</h>
            <ul>
            <li>A profile is a grouping of your application code.</li>
            <li>A class or method may belong to more than one profile.</li>
            <li>A class or method's membership in a profile is based on the profile's criteria.</li>
            <li>A profile may have one or more handlers.</li>
            </ul>

            Profiles can be given names, however these names are optional and are
            only used for logging and error messages.

            <section>
                <h>Criteria</h>

                Multiple <b>include</b> and <b>exclude</b> tags may be used to build complex
                matching criteria.

                A profile matches if the <b>include</b> clauses match and none of the <b>exclude</b>
                clauses match.
